# Vite PWA

Welcome to your new PWA, powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vite Plugin PWA](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-pwa), and [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox)! There are three main commands for you to run to start developing your PWA:

- `npm run dev` - Run the development server to develop your PWA
- `npm run build` - Create a production build of your site, by default into the `dist` directory
- `npm run serve` - Preview your production build

## Powerful PWAs

This starter is only the beginning. [Learn more](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) about how to take this codebase and improve the install experience, create an app-like user experience, make your [offline experience even better](https://web.dev/reliable/). Then, [make it powerful](https://chromeos.dev/en/web/powerful-pwas) by adding new web APIs to supercharge your user experience. You can even [build a checklist of capabilities](https://chromeos.dev/en/web/powerful-pwas#your-pwa-checklist) you want to add, or see checklists for different kinds of apps you may want to build.
